# PurePos

PurePos is an open source Hidden Markov model based morphological tagger tool that has an interface to an integrated morphological analyzer and thus performs full disambiguated morphological analysis including stemming of words both known and unknown to the morphological analyzer. The tagger is implemented in Java using algorithms from HunPos implementation and has a permissive LGPL license thus it is easy to integrate and modify. It is fast to train and use while having an accuracy on par with HunPos and TnT and also with slow to train Maximum Entropy or Conditional Random Field based taggers. Full integration with morphology and an incremental training feature make it suited for integration in web based applications.

It is distributed under LGPL license.

# Compiling
For compilation Maven 2 is needed. After installing it, run in the root of the code: <br/>
`mvn package`

# Usage

For trainig the tagger needs a text file, that has the following format:

* each sentence is in a new line,
* each word has a lemma and a POS tag: `word#lemma#tag`, that are separated with a space.

For tagging, you must provide a file that has:

* sentences in new lines,
* words separated by a space.
